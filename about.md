## Description
This is a course on climate governance, which we take to broadly include the drivers and consequences of policies associated with the distributional outcomes stemming from climate change. Climate change is one of the most dire problems facing contemporary society. A large part of these challenges are social and political in nature, which we can address using sound social scientific research. In this course, students will begin to acquire the skills needed to do this kind of work. First, students will be introduced to concepts in policy studies and topics in contemporary climate governance. Second, with applications to climate governance, students will take a hands-on approach to learning how to conduct policy-relevant research using their preferred methodological approach. These research projects will be done through teams comprising 3-4 students, and the final output is a short policy brief or academic article on some topic in climate governance.

### Target Learning Outcomes
At the end of this course, students will:
- Be able to summarize topical themes in climate governance
- Have a working knowledge of the policy process
- Have obtained the skills to communicate expert knowledge to lay audiences
- Have produced a team-based research report that is relevant for climate governance and policy

## Course Expectations

### Classroom Organization
This course will be organized primarily around in-person sessions. Generally speaking, each lesson will have an interactive lecture followed by some time for group work, at which time the instructors will rotate between teams to help as needed. This means that being in the same location is important. However, we are cognizant that some students will need to attend the course remotely. To accomodate this, at least the lecture portion of the course will be viewable remotely. Depending on how many students require remote attendance, we may be able to coordinate remote group work among those students.

We will use a Slack workspace to organize team work. Each team will have its own channel, and this will make is easier for the instructors to keep track of progress and help out where possible.

### Students can expect from the course
- Instructors from the University of Helsinki who are social scientists experienced with climate policy research in multidisciplinary teams.
- Instructors who will respect students' backgrounds and strive to make the course an inclusive learning environment by following the course [Code of Conduct]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link conduct.md %}).
- Lessons primarily organized for in-person sessions, but efforts will be made to accomodate remote learning.
- Potential to collaborate with one or more instructors on an academic paper based on a course project. We are open to working with students who wish to pursue an academic career. More detail will be provided during the first class.

### We expect from students
- Commitment to research and hands-on learning. This is a research-based course, where lectures are designed as supporting material. We conceive of research broadly, including academic and policy-oriented research.
- Respect for everyone involved with the course (i.e. students, instructors, guest lecturers), and follow the course [Code of Conduct]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link conduct.md %}). It is especially important to understand that teams will comprise members from diverse and multidisciplinary backgrounds. A large part of this course is learning to work in these types of teams. Communication and patience are paramount.
- Full attendance, as much as possible. Students will be working in teams, and missed sessions are difficult to make up.
- Basics: do the readings; come to class; contribute to team work.

## Assessment
Assessment tasks for the course will be organized around a written project students undertake in teams. Based on their interests and career goals, students can choose from a number of different topics, written as either a short research paper or policy brief. The grading breakdown is summarized in the table below; note that there is a peer evaluation component where team members evaluate one another on their effort. 

More information on these topics can be found on the [projects page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects.md %}).

### Project topics
Teams can choose from a project provided by the instruction team, for which they will be provided some data to use. Teams are free to choose their own project, with approval from the instructors. If you choose your own project, you are responsible for your own data, but instructors will help as much as possible.

The topics listed here are broad topics that can cover multiple team projects. More details will be provided in the first class.
- How do policy actors communicate with each other? Why?
- What is the role of science in the climate policy process?
- Understanding public opinion on climate change.
- Quantifying the social consequences of climate change.
